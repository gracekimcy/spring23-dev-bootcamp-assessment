            <p class="bioText">Grace is a first-year computer science major with threads in Intelligence and Theory.
                She was born in Australia, lived in South Korea, and moved to the United States
                in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C. when she was nine years old.
                She enjoys community service and utilizing her knowledge and skills to help others.
                In high school, she received the NCWIT Aspirations in Computing Award
                for her recognition as an advocate for human trafficking survivors in computer science,
                TR Cook Youth Awards of Excellence Winner in Tech
                for starting Girls Who Code chapters to address the gender gap in technology, and
                President’s Volunteer Service Award
                for spending 300+ hours teaching Korean culture and language to young Korean Americans in her community.
                In her free time, she enjoys exploring Atlanta, visiting cafes, cooking, and traveling
                (she’ll be participating in the College of Computing’s Berlin study abroad program this summer!).
